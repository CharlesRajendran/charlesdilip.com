# Getting started with Textract

A deeplearning OCR service by AWS for application developers to extract text from documents. Amazon Textract includes simple, easy-to-use APIs that can analyze image files and PDF files. Amazon Textract is always learning from new data, and weâ€™re continually adding new features to the service.

## Detecting Text

#### What API's to use to detect text synchronously?
Amazon Textract provides synchronous operations for processing small, single-page, documents and for getting near real-time responses. To detect text synchronously, use the **DetectDocumentText** API operation. 

#### What API's to use to detect text Asynchronously?
Amazon Textract also provides asynchronous operations that you can use to process larger, multipage documents. To detect text asynchronously, use **StartDocumentTextDetection** to start processing an input document file. To get the results, call **GetDocumentTextDetection**. The results are returned in one or more responses from **GetDocumentTextDetection**. 

## Analyzing Text
Amazon Textract analysis operations (API's) return 3 categories of text extraction,

  - TEXT: The raw text extracted from a document, with lines and word blocks. 
  
  - FORMS: Form data is linked text items, Amazon Textract represents form data as key-value pairs. Key-value pairs are also used to represent check boxes or option buttons (radio buttons).
  
  - TABLES: Amazon Textract can extract tables, table cells, and the items within table cells.

#### What API's to use to analys text synchronously?
To analyze text synchronously, use the **AnalyzeDocument** operation, and pass a document as input. **AnalyzeDocument** returns the entire set of results. 

#### What API's to use to analys text asynchronously?
- You can identify relationships between detected text on a multipage document. The asynchronous operations are **StartDocumentAnalysis** and **GetDocumentAnalysis**. 

- **NOTE**: To specify which type of analysis to perform, you can use the `FeatureTypes` list input parameter in the request. Detected text will be in anyway in the response, even though we didn't mention in the `FeatureTypes`.
  - **TABLES**: Add `TABLES` to the list to return information about the tables that are detected in the input document, for example, table cells, cell text, and selection elements in cells. 
  - **FORMS**: Add `FORMS` to return word relationships, such as key-value pairs and selection elements. 


## Documents and It's Limits in Textract

- Synchronous operations can process JPEG and PNG format images.

- In Asynchronous operations, **Multipage documents must be in PDF format**. Single-page documents processed with asynchronous operations can be in JPEG, PNG, or PDF format.

- Limits in Amazon Textract
  - maximum image (JPEG/PNG) size is **5 MB**.
  - maximum PDF file size is **500 MB**.
  - maximum number of pages in a PDF file is **3000**.
  - The minimum height for text to be detected is **15 pixels**. (At 150 DPI, this would be equivalent to 8-pt font.)
  - Amazon Textract doesn't support the **detection of handwriting**.

- How to pass documents as input
  - Synchronous: input documents that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, or you can pass **base64-encoded** image bytes.
  - Aynchronous: you need to supply input documents in an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Block Object in response
When an Amazon Textract operation processes a document, the results are returned in an array of Block objects. A **Block object** contains information that's detected about items, including their location on the document and their relationship to other items on the document. 

kind of informations in the response's block section,
- The lines and words of detected text

- The relationships between the lines and words of detected text

- The page that the detected text appears on

- The location of the lines and words of text on the document page

#### Contents in block objects
## BlockType

- Pages

  - A `PAGE` block object contains a list of the `Child ID`s for the lines of **Text**, **key-value pairs**, and **Tables** that are detected on the document page.
  
  - With a multipage document that's in PDF format, you can determine the page that a block is located on by inspecting the `Page field` of the Block object.
    - Asynchronous operations always return a Page value of 1 for scanned images. 
    - Synchronous operations don't include the Page field, because they only process a scanned image (always a single-page document).
```json
{
    "Geometry": .... 
    "Relationships": [
        {
            "Type": "CHILD", 
            "Ids": [
                "2602b0a6-20e3-4e6e-9e46-3be57fd0844b", Line - Hello, world.
                "82aedd57-187f-43dd-9eb1-4f312ca30042", Line - How are you?

    "Id": "8136b2dc-37c1-4300-a9da-6ed8b276ea97"
}
```
<br>

- Lines and words of text
    -  A **LINE** is a string of **tab-delimited**.
    - Detected text is returned in the `Text field` of a Block object.
    - To detect only lines and words, you can use **DetectDocumentText** or **StartDocumentTextDetection**. 
    - To get the detected text (lines and words) and information about how it relates to other parts of the document, such as tables, you can use **AnalyzeDocument** or **StartDocumentAnalysis**.

```json

<br>

- Form data (Key-value pairs)
    - key-value pairs are returned as Block objects in the responses from **AnalyzeDocument** and **GetDocumentAnalysis**, when you use FeatureTypes input parameter as `FORMS`.
    - Block objects with the block type `KEY_VALUE_SET` are the containers for `KEY` or `VALUE` Block objects.
      - A KEY block has two relationship lists. A relationship of type VALUE is a list that contains the ID of the VALUE block that's associated with the key.
      - A VALUE block has a relationship with a list of CHILD blocks that identify WORD blocks.
        -  A VALUE object can also contain information about selected elements.

- Same can be applied to Table cell aswell.

## Geometry
  -  The Geometry object contains two types of location and geometric information for detected items:
     -  An axis-aligned BoundingBox object that contains the top-left coordinate and the width and height of the item. 
        -  BoundingBox property has a value between 0 and 1. The value is a ratio of the overall image
           -   For example, if the input image is 700 x 200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is (350,50) pixels, the API returns a Left value of 0.5 (350/700) and a Top value of 0.25 (50/200).

        -  Height â€“ The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page height.
        -  Left â€“ The X coordinate of the top-left point of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page width.
